## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- The only trouble I had was trying to fetch posts from different Tumblr blogs, I kept getting errors so I decided not to implement it in the project, but I might try again and re-submit.
    - Update: I was able to fetch posts form a different blog and I now know what I was doing wrong :)
